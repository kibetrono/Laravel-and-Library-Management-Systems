		<p>Honey harvested harvested from bee can be marketed for processing </p>
		<h3 style="color:green">products</h3>
		<p>There is currently a very high demand for honey both in Kenya and overseas. Kenya is now licensed to export honey to the European Union. Market opportunity exists for beekeepers but lack of production is at present the main constraint in Kenyan beekeeping. Good quality honey can fetch a high price.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Crude honey. This is a mixture of ripe and unripe honey. At harvesting time, the wax, honeycomb, and bee-and-brood comb are all mixed into one container. This container is often an old tin. Crude honey is used mainly for brewing local beer because quality requirements are not very strict. The demand for this type of honey is high.</li>
			<li>Semi-refined honey. Semi-refined honey is generally the liquid honey that remains when you skim wax off the top of crude honey. Honey sinks to the bottom as it is heavier</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>Refined honey. Refined honey is clean. You strain it to remove all particles of beeswax and other materials. Remember: refined honey is unchanged, it is only strained</li>

	     		<h3 style="color: green">Honey processing</h3>
	     		<p>Honey processing is the action of preparing honey to improve its shelf life and meet the customer's and consumer's preferences. The main methods of honey processing are: Honey straining: This is done soon after harvesting before honey granulates because granulation makes straining difficult. Staining must be carried out in a room free from robber bees. On large or small scale honey production honey straining can be done using</p>
	     		<ul>
	     			<li>A honey press</li>
	     			<li>filter tank</li>
	     			<li>Bamboo honey strainer</li>
	     			<li>perforated plastic basin.</li>
	     		</ul>
	     		<h3 style="color: green">Rifining honey </h3>
	     		<li>step 1;Remove wax capping from combs using a knife to cut off the capping.</li>
	     		<li>Step 2;Break combs into smaller particles and sieve them through a net or nylon fabric into a plastic container (See Photo 36.) The sieving process can take a few days. Cover sieved honey with a lid and keep in a dry room away from bees.</li>
	     		<li>step 3; You can place the bucket in sunshine for two or three hours to heat honey gently so it flows freely.</li>

	     	<p>Package honey in either plastic or glass jars, which should be clean and dry.</p>

	     <p>marketing of honey can be done in several ways</p>
