			<p>kenya second as milk producer in africa after south africa small scale production of milk account to 80 percent and large scale production 20 percent.Inorder to address the issue of food security there is a need to close this gap by adoption of exotic breed by farmers this breeds are known to produce alot of milk as compared to indeginous during the lactation period</p>
<h2 class="well"style="color: green" >Exotic Breeds</h2>
<p>Leading dairy in milk production during the lactation period are; fresians,Aysher,Gurnsey and jersey.</p>
<h2 class="well" style="color:green">Fresian</h2>
<p>The exact origins of the breed are difficult to determine but it is known that in the 18th century, herds of small black-and-white cattle were brought into northern Holland and Friesland from northern Jutland to replace animals that had fallen victim to disease and flooding. These animals were crossed with the existing Dutch cattle and formed the basis of the Friesian.During the 1970's Holsteins were imported from the United States and used to improve the milk production. This resulted in larger animals with a more pronounced dairy characteristics. The mixing of these two breeds is such that now many Friesians are 25% to 75% Holstein.</p>

<h3 style="color: green">Advantages</h3>
<ul> 
<li> milk production potential with low butter fat content of about 3.2%</li>
    <li> for zero grazing</li>
    <li>calving in their lifetime, longevity, so need less replacements</li>
    <li> valuable male calves</li>
    <li> lower cell counts</li>
    <li>They are known for their versatility: they provide high quality milk and high quality lean meat<</ul>

<h3 style="color: green">Disadvantages:</h3>
<ul>
 </li>feeder</li>
   <li>Need high level management</li>
   <li>Susceptible to diseases, susceptible to milk fever</li>
   <li>Susceptible to high temperatures </li>
   <li>Feed requirements high (90-110 kg fresh forage/day i.e. 3 gunny bags)</li>
   <li>Adequate clean water (min 60 lts/day, more for heavy yielders)</li>

<h2 class="well" style="color: green">Ayrshire</h2>
<p>The Ayrshire breed originated from the county of Ayr in Scotland, prior to 1800. The breed was introduced to Kenya in 1908 from South Africa. It has been developed over the last century through inputs of bloodlines from Britain, South Africa, Sweden, New-Zealand, Canada and USA. 
Kenya Aryshire cattle breeders emphasize on medium cow balanced for type, production, longer life and fertility. Ayrshire population in Kenya is estimated to be over 1.2 million of which nearly 30'000 are registered.
 </p>
 <h3 class="well"style="color:green">characteristics</h3>
 <p>Purpose: Milk production. Ayrshire milk is referred as "the ideal drinking milk"; it is not excessively rich, not lacking adequate fat, and it possesses desirable quantities of proteins.
Potential yield: 30 litres/day, 4,7% butter fat, depending on feeding and management.
Average yield: 10 litres/day
Average body size: Large (average live-weight 450 kg)
color:Brown and white patches.

	<h2 class="well" style="color: green">Guernsey</h2>
	<p>The Guernsey originated on the small Isle of Guernsey, situated in the English Channel just off the coast of France. There is no concrete evidence as to the development of the Guernsey before the 19th Century but there may be some truth in the theory that the Isigny cattle of Normandy and the Froment du Leon breed from Brittany were ancestral relatives of the modern Guernsey.</p>

<h3 class="well" style="color: green">characterists</h3>
	<p>Milk production. Heifers generally come into milk at about two years of age.
      Potential yield: 25 litres/day and 4.3% butter fat.
      Average body size: Medium (average live-weight 475 kg).
      The bull weighs 600 to 700 kg. The average weaning weight of heifers and bull calves is 75 kg.
      color:From yellow to reddish-brown with white patches

		<h2 class="well" style="color: green">jersey</h2>
		<p>Despite considerable research, nothing definite is known as to the actual origin of the cattle first brought to Jersey Island. Most research agrees that the Jersey probably originated from the adjacent coast of France, where in Normaaling Jerseys are found</p>

	<ul>
	<li>Milk production</li>
<li>yield: 22 litres/day and 6.3% butter fat</li>
<li> body size: Small - medium (350 Kg)</li>
<li>Jerseys in Kenya are typically light brown in colour, though this can range from being almost grey to dull black. They can also have white patches which may cover much of the animal. A true Jersey will however always have a black nose bordered by an almost white muzzle.</li> 
<li> They have protruding eyes</li>
<li> This breed is well known for milk with high quality - it is particularly richer in fat, protein, minerals and trace elements than those from the larger dairy breeds. The milk is also rich in colour which is naturally produced from carotene</li>
